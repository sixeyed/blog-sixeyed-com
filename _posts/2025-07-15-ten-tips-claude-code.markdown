[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) is Anthropic's agentic coding tool that transforms AI pair programming. It lets you delegate development tasks directly from your VS Code terminal - you describe what you want, and a team of Claudes build it while you focus on the bigger picture. 

My journey with Claude Code went like this:
-  _mildly skeptical_ ðŸ¤” 
- _pleasantly surprised_ ðŸ˜¯
- _thoroughly impressed_ ðŸ¤¯
- _cannot live without_ ðŸš€ 

This Claude Code tutorial covers 10 battle-tested tips from real projects that will help you work like a tech lead with an AI development team at your command.

> **Quick Summary**: Claude Code transforms you from a coder into a development director. These 10 Claude Code best practices will help you manage multiple AI coding agents, maintain code quality, and dramatically increase productivity. Time required: 5 minutes to read, hours of new free time to fill.

## Getting Started with Claude Code

Setting up is straightforward: [create a free account](https://claude.ai/login), install the [Claude Code extension in VS Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/ide-integrations), authenticate and you're ready. Open a terminal, type `claude` and start describing what you need. The real power comes from understanding how to work with it effectively.

> I used Claude Code to build an entire [multi-cloud AKS/EKS demo application](https://github.com/sixeyed/multi-cloud-demo). With a few hours of guidance, Claude completed what would have taken me at least 3 days to write myself.

## 1. Run Multiple Claude Instances: Multitask Like a Manager

Run multiple Claude instances across different terminal windows. While one's building your API endpoints, another can work on the frontend, and a third can write your deployment scripts. Switch between them to provide guidance - it's like having a team of developers who are extremely eager and who know _everything_.

Make sure you have plenty of things on the go - work, pet projects, blogs, tech explorations. And don't be afraid to let it loop - prompts like "keep iterating on the build: fix any issues with the terraform config and deployment scripts, run the script, watch the outcome and repeat until it works" will keep Claude busy. 

It's the new ABC: **Always Be Clauding**.

## 2. Delegate Debugging: Let Claude Do the Work

When something's broken, resist the urge to fix it yourself. That's not why you're here. Describe the problem and let Claude handle the implementation. If you're diving into the code to make changes, you're going too deep. Stay at the design level where you add the most value.

Claude will use all the same debugging tools you use to find issues (it asks permission first and stores the permissions you've granted). If you see an error log, just give it to Claude and it will use `kubectl` to examine your Pods and Services, `curl` to test endpoints, `nslookup` for DNS queries and so on. 

## 3. Code Review Mindset: Roll With AI-Generated Code

Claude's code isn't going to look like yours. That's fine. Treat it like you're reviewing someone's PR - does it meet the requirements? Is it maintainable? If you have standards, enforce them in the repo. Don't get hung up on style differences. The goal is working software, not perfect alignment with your personal preferences.

## 4. Rapid Prototyping: Design and Iterate on the Fly

Coding is cheap now. Really cheap. Need to refactor the entire architecture? Just ask. Want to switch from REST to GraphQL? Claude can handle it. Don't overthink the initial design - build something that works, then iterate. It's liberating when a complete redesign takes minutes, not days.

## 5. Git Best Practices: Stay in Control of Commits

Claude can commit code and write commit messages, but don't let it run on autopilot. Review the diffs, commit frequently, and keep your Git history clean. You want to understand what's changing - that's how you maintain ownership of the codebase.

## 6. Beyond Application Code: Let Claude Handle Infrastructure

Don't just use it for application code. Claude can write your [Dockerfiles](/learn-docker-in-a-month-of-lunches/), [Kubernetes](/learn-kubernetes-in-a-month-of-lunches/) manifests, [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configs, CI/CD pipelines, test suites, documentation, architecture, tech stack. Push the boundaries - you'll be surprised at what it can do. It has memorized the entire Internet, after all (probably).

## 7. Troubleshooting Complex Tasks: Be Persistent

Some tasks are harder for Claude than others. I've had situations where it took a dozen prompts to get a local LGTM stack running, or to authenticate to a new EKS cluster. When it struggles, approach from different angles. Rephrase your requirements, break complex tasks into steps, feed in error messages, or provide examples. Like any team member, Claude sometimes needs extra guidance to get unstuck.

## 8. CLAUDE.md Best Practices: Provide Context Upfront

Create a [`CLAUDE.md` file](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory) in your project root. This is where you document everything Claude needs to know - architecture decisions, tech stack, naming conventions, project structure, and coding standards. Claude Code automatically reads this file, so you don't need to repeat yourself. 

A good `CLAUDE.md` is like a comprehensive onboarding doc for a new developer - and you can ask Claude to update it at the end of a session with new learnings, which it will pick up next time. Here's what it looks like - create it with the `/init` command when you bring Claude onto the project and keep it current with prompts:

```
# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Memory File

## Project Overview
This is a multi-cloud Kubernetes demo application showcasing how containerized .NET applications can be deployed consistently across different cloud providers. The application demonstrates modern microservices patterns, message queuing, database persistence, and Kubernetes deployment best practices.

## Architecture

### Components
- **WebApp**: ASP.NET Core web application with Razor Pages
  - Form for message submission
  - Messages page displaying processed data from SQL Server
  - Modern gradient UI design with 3rem font sizes
  - Antiforgery tokens disabled for demo simplicity
```

## 9. Async Work Queue: Batch Your Changes

While Claude is working on a longer task, queue up your next prompts. If you know you'll need API tests after the endpoints are done, type that prompt and hit enter - Claude will pick it up when ready. This keeps Claude productive while you check on your other instances. It's like having a queue of work that you can fill ahead of time.

## 10. Knowledge Management: Capture and Reuse Prompts

Ask Claude to dump all the prompts from your session to a text file in the repo. It's incredibly useful to see how the development evolved - what worked, what needed clarification, how you refined requirements. These prompt histories become scaffolding for your next similar project. You'll build up a library of effective prompts that you can reuse and adapt.

## Claude Code Pricing and Usage Limits

Don't get too hung up on the details - which model you're using or which plan you're on. I use the more advanced [Opus 4 model](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings#model-selection) by default, but Claude automatically switches to Sonnet 4 when you're running low on credits, and it's perfectly capable. 

The [usage restrictions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/costs) are very fair - when you hit the limits, they reset after a period. More expensive plans have bigger limits and shorter reset periods. Just focus on being productive with whatever you have.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is Claude Code free to use?**  
A: Claude Code offers a free tier with limited usage. Paid plans provide higher limits and access to more powerful models like Opus 4.

**Q: Does Claude Code work with languages other than JavaScript?**  
A: Yes! Claude Code supports all major programming languages including Python, Java, C#, Go, Rust, and more.

**Q: Can Claude Code work with existing codebases?**  
A: Absolutely. Claude Code can analyze and modify existing code. The CLAUDE.md file helps it understand your project structure and conventions.

**Q: How does Claude Code compare to GitHub Copilot?**  
A: While Copilot offers inline suggestions, Claude Code works at a higher level - managing entire features and projects through conversation. It's more like having an AI pair programming partner who can handle complex, multi-file tasks.

**Q: Can I use Claude Code for production applications?**  
A: Yes, but always review Claude's code thoroughly. Treat it like any code review - check for security issues, performance concerns, and adherence to your coding standards.

## The Future of AI-Assisted Development

Claude Code fundamentally changes how we write software. Instead of coding, you're directing. Instead of debugging syntax, you're validating solutions. Embrace this new way of working - you will suddenly become hugely more productive.

I imagine the next step will be a higher level still - you'll plug Claude into your product backlog and set X number of instances running to do the entire project. One Claude will test and review the work of another Claude, and maybe there will be a manager Claude who takes over the director role. 

But for now, you are the director.
