I get to speak and run workshops at fantastic conferences and user groups, talking mostly about Docker, Windows containers and .NET apps (although I also talk about SQL Server, Linux, Node.js, DevOps, architecture and more).

You'll find all the source code for my session demos on GitHub at [sixeyed/presentations](https://github.com/sixeyed/presentations) and my slide decks are all on [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/sixeyed/presentations).

> If you'd like me to speak at your event, [@EltonStoneman on Twitter](https://twitter.com/EltonStoneman) is the best way to get hold of me.
