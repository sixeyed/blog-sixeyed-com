## [NDC Oslo](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-London/) | [June 15th](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/the-hybrid-docker-swarm-mashing-windows-and-linux-apps-with-containers/)

### The Hybrid Docker Swarm: Mashing Windows and Linux Apps with Containers

> Linux containers run on Linux. Windows containers run on Windows. You can't mix them on a single host, but you can build a cluster of hosts into a single Docker Swarm, using a mixture of Windows and Linux servers. That swarm can run both Windows and Linux containers, and within the swarm all the containers can talk to each other.

> This session will show you how to make that happen, but more importantly you'll see why it's a such an important capability - one that will change the way you design, build and deliver software. With a hybrid Docker Swarm you can build a distributed solution where you pick the right technology stack for each component, and leverage high-quality open-source applications to minimize the amount of custom software you need to write and maintain.

> We'll take an existing ASP.NET application, built to run on Windows and IIS, and split out a couple of components into separate services. Then we'll containerize the whole solution into a suite of Docker images that each use the right OS for the job - Windows Server Core, Windows Nano Server or Linux. We'll deploy the whole stack in a hybrid Docker Swarm in Azure, and explore the benefits of running a distributed cross-platform application within a single cluster boundary.

### Dockerizing Legacy ASP.NET Apps

> Docker has the potential to revolutionize how we build, deliver, support and even design software. But it doesn’t have to be a violent revolution. The end goal might be breaking your existing ASP.NET monolith into microservices which run cross-platform on .NET Core, but the first step can be as simple as packaging your whole application as-is into a Docker image and running it as a container.

> In this session we’ll take an existing ASP.NET MVC application and package it as a Docker container image, which we can run on Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10. We’ll see where the packaging process fits in a CI/CD build, and deploy our app on a clustered Docker Swarm running in Azure. That gives us a scalable, reliable platform for our legacy app, and we’ll end by exploring where that can take us.

### Windows Containers and Docker: Now is the Time [Workshop]

> Windows Server 2016 is out with native support for Windows containers. Will application containers become the preferred delivery model? They surely will, and now is the time to be part of the revolution.

> In this workshop you’ll learn why containerization is the next big thing in computing. You’ll pick up the technical skills you need to build and run solutions based on containers, but also explore the architectural benefits of a design based on Docker.

### Modernizing .NET Apps with Docker

> Docker has the potential to revolutionise how we build, deliver, support and even design software. But it doesn't have to be a violent revolution. The end goal might be breaking your existing ASP.NET monolith into Microservices which run cross-platform on .NET Core, but the first step can be as simple as packaging your whole application as-is into a Docker image and running it as a container.

> In this session we'll take an existing ASP.NET WebForms application and package it as a Docker image, which we can run in a container on Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10. We'll see where the packaging process fits in a CI/CD build, and iteratively add functionality to the app. We'll use a feature-driven approach to modernize the app with the Docker platform, and transform the monolith without rebuilding it.

## [Manchester IP Expo](http://www.ipexpomanchester.com) | [April 26th](http://www.ipexpomanchester.com/Seminar-Planner/Keynote-Theatre/Wednesday-26-April-2017/Where-Docker-fits-in-Windows-Enterprises)

### Where Docker Fits in Windows Enterprises

> Docker is revolutionizing how companies build and manage software. It's a platform which supports a simple workflow for building, shipping and running applications.

> Apps are packaged as a single unit in Docker - with all their dependencies and configuration settings in one place. That package can be shared on a public registry, or on a private registry in your enterprise. Anyone with access can download the package and run the application with a single command. And the application will behave the same way wherever you run it - on a laptop, or a server in the data centre, or a VM in the cloud - because the package contains everything it needs.

> In this session I'll cover where Docker fits in Windows enterprises, showing how Windows apps run in Docker, and what that means for development, operations and the business.

## [DockerCon](https://2017.dockercon.com/) | [April 17th-20th](https://dockercon.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=107848)

### Escape From Your VMs with Image2Docker

> Migrating apps out of Virtual Machines is difficult, especially distributed apps with multiple components, and even more so when the components run on different operating systems. But with the Docker platform and the Image2Docker tools - which extract Linux and Windows apps from existing VMs into containers - it's easy.

> In this session we'll take a PHP front-end application running in a Linux VM, which connects to a .NET Web Service running in a Windows VM, and convert the whole stack to Docker automatically. Then we'll run the app on a hybrid Docker Datacenter cluster, where we can manage the Windows and Linux components from a single pane of glass.

### Modernizing Monolithic ASP.NET Applications with Docker [Workshop]

> Learn how to use Docker to run traditional ASP.NET applications In Windows containers without an application re-write. We’ll use Docker tools to containerize a monolithic ASP.NET app, then see how the platform helps us iterate quickly - pulling high-value features out of the app and running them in separate containers. This workshop gives you a roadmap for modernizing your own ASP.NET workloads.

### Docker and Windows: The State of the Union

> Docker runs natively on Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10, so you can run Windows workloads in containers right now. It's the same Docker Engine, API and client for Linux and Windows, but feature parity isn't yet complete. In this session we'll see how Docker works on Windows and how to Dockerize .NET applications, then we'll focus on the differences running Docker in Linux and Windows.
