I've been authoring training courses with [Pluralsight](/l/ps-home) since 2013, covering a range of topics - mainly Docker, .NET and Azure, but with some architecture, AWS and Linux content too.

This page has an up-to-date list of all my courses, with their current user rating and an excerpt.

####[Monitoring Containerized Application Health with Docker](/l/ps-home) &nbsp; 

> Containers are the best way to run new and old server applications, but before you go to production you need to understand a new approach to monitoring - one that works when you have dozens or hundreds of short-lived containers.

> This course gives you that understanding. I'll explain how monitoring works in Docker, exposing metrics from your containers and running other containers to collect the metrics and visualize them in a friendly dashboard.

> You'll learn how to build three levels of monitoring into your dashboards, so you can see what's happening in your applications, in your containers, and in the Docker platform itself.

> I'll be using Java apps in Linux containers and .NET apps in Windows containers, so you'll see how to make monitoring consistent across different technology stacks. And I'll be running on single Docker servers and on Docker swarm, so you'll learn how container monitoring works the same way in every environment.

> By the end of the course you’ll understand how to add effective monitoring into your own applications, using industry-standard tools and techniques.

####[Managing Load Balancing and Scale in Docker Swarm Mode Clusters](/l/ps-home) &nbsp; 

> Docker swarm mode is a production-grade container orchestrator with built-in features for load-balancing and scaling your applications. In this course you'll learn how to deploy and manage applications in swarm mode for high availability, high performance, and easy scale.

> First, you'll learn how load balancing and service discovery works in swarm mode. Then you'll learn how to scale your services and your swarm - with Linux and Windows nodes. Finally, you'll learn how to run multiple applications and maximize the use of your cluster, and how swarm mode supports production maintenance and deployment.

> When you’re finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge to run performance reliable apps in production with Docker swarm mode.

Released: 23 March 2018

####[Modernizing .NET Framework Apps with Docker](/l/ps-home) &nbsp; 

> Docker isn't just for greenfield microservices applications, you can take full .NET Framework applications and run them in containers with no code changes. That's a great starting point for modernizing the architecture and moving to the cloud.

> In this course you'll learn how to efficiently run .NET applications and create a more modern architecture utilizing Docker. First, you'll discover how to package and run .NET apps in Docker containers on Windows. Then, you'll explore how to evolve the application architecture by breaking features out into separate containers. Finally, you'll delve into taking your modernized app to production on Azure.

> By the end of the course, you'll understand how Docker works on Windows and what Docker can do for your existing .NET landscape.

Released: 28 December 2017

####[Getting Started with Docker Datacenter](/l/ps-docker-datacenter) &nbsp; 

> Developers love [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for its simple approach to packaging, distributing, and running applications. The open source Docker ecosystem provides a lot of tools, but before you put container workloads in production you'll want enterprise-grade security, management, and support. [Docker Datacenter](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-datacenter) provides that for multi-node installations of Docker on-premises and in virtual private clouds.

> In this course you'll learn about all of the features of Docker Datacenter: the supported Docker Engine, [Docker Trusted Registry](https://docs-stage.docker.com/docker-trusted-registry/) and [Universal Control Plane](https://docs-stage.docker.com/ucp/overview/). First, you'll discover how to digitally sign images. Next, you'll explore how to run and scale container workloads. Then, you'll learn how to use role-based access control to secure Docker components. Finally, you'll cover how to set up Docker Datacenter as a highly available cluster.

> By the end of this course, you'll be able to run your own trial of Docker Datacenter.

Released: 6 January 2017

####[Hadoop for .NET Developers](/l/ps-home) &nbsp; 

> Big Data is an established discipline, and every company can benefit from storing and analyzing large amounts of data to improve their products and services. [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) is the key technology in Big Data, but it's too often seen as something which is only for Java and Linux people. This course will teach you how to use this key technology.

> First, you'll learn how to bring Hadoop into a Microsoft environment. You'll also discover how to run the services on Windows and create fast, understandable MapReduce queries in .NET using C#. The course takes a proof-of-concept approach, demonstrating how to evaluate Hadoop on Windows with .NET and .NET Core. By the end of the course, you'll be able to start your own Hadoop journey with confidence.

Released: 29 August 2016

####[Managing Azure IaaS with PowerShell](/l/ps-home) &nbsp; 

> Hosting your [infrastructure on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/virtual-machines/) is a powerful option, but with great power comes a lot of management overhead. In this course you'll learn how to automate IaaS setup, configuration and management on Azure with PowerShell. We look at moving an existing deployment composed of Linux and Windows app servers to the cloud.

> We start with a basic deployment, then move on to custom disk images, and automated deployment with [PowerShell DSC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/overview) and [Azure Resource Manager templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/resource-group-template-deploy/). The course rounds off with some typical admin tasks, covering security, performance, and monitoring. By the end of this course, you'll be able to manage and host your infrastructure on Azure with ease.

Released: 10 April 2015

#### [HDInsight Deep Dive: Storm, HBase, and Hive](/l/ps-home) &nbsp; 

> [HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/hdinsight/) is Microsoft's managed Big Data stack in the cloud. With Azure you can provision clusters running [Storm](http://storm.apache.org/), [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/), and [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) which can process thousands of events per second, store petabytes of data, and give you a SQL-like interface to query it all. In this course, we'll build out a full solution using the stack and take a deep dive into each of the technologies.

Released: 6 November 2015
