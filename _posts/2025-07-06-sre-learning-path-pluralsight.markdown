[Site Reliability Engineering](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/) is how Google runs production systems, and it's becoming the standard approach for managing complex applications at scale. I've just published the first two courses in a new [SRE learning path on Pluralsight](/l/ps-sre-path), with two more courses coming soon to complete the path.

SRE achieves the same goals as [DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops) - high availability with high velocity - but without requiring a massive culture shift. It's an engineering approach to operations that focuses on automation, measurement, and removing toil. For many organizations starting their digital transformation, SRE provides a more structured path forward than traditional DevOps adoption.

I cover the easy(ish) way to add reliability at scale with container orchestration in my 5\* Pluralsight course [Managing Apps on Kubernetes with Istio](/l/ps-istio).

## The SRE Learning Path

The complete [Site Reliability Engineering learning path](/l/ps-sre-path) takes you from SRE fundamentals through to advanced practices:

1. [SRE: Concepts and Principles](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/sre-concepts-principles)
2. [SRE: Monitoring and Observability](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/sre-monitoring-observability)
3. SRE: Resiliency and Automation _(coming soon)_
4. SRE: Measuring and Optimizing Reliability _(coming soon)_

Let's dive into what's covered in the first two courses.

## Course 1: SRE Concepts and Principles

[SRE: Concepts and Principles](/l/ps-sre-concepts) is your entry point into Site Reliability Engineering. Over 90 minutes, you'll follow two experienced SREs as they deal with real production scenarios.

### What You'll Learn

The course covers the foundational SRE concepts through practical demonstrations:

- How SRE differs from traditional IT operations and DevOps
- Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and error budgets
- Incident management and the importance of blameless postmortems
- Core SRE tools for monitoring and alerting
- Automation, automation, automation

![Automation is the key principle in SRE](/content/images/2025/07/sre-1-automate.png)

### Course Outline

**Module 1: Investigating Issues: On-Call with an SRE**  
Follow an on-call SRE dealing with a disk space issue in [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/). You'll see how SREs approach problems differently from traditional ops teams, using engineering practices to solve operational challenges.

**Module 2: Classifying and Tracking Performance with Service Levels**  
Join another SRE investigating a performance issue that's burning through error budget. This module explains the key concepts of SLIs and SLOs while demonstrating logging and distributed tracing tools.

**Module 3: Managing Risk and Reducing Downtime**  
Learn how to use monitoring tools like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to confirm root causes and work with development teams on architectural solutions.

**Module 4: Handling Failure with Incident Management**  
When the initial fix doesn't work and the incident escalates, you'll see how SREs use a structured incident management approach to investigate and get to quick resolution.

**Module 5: Reflecting and Improving Practices with Postmortems**  
Wrap up with a blameless postmortem that connects both incidents and provides a path forward for preventing future issues.



## Course 2: SRE Monitoring and Observability

[SRE: Monitoring and Observability](/l/ps-sre-monitoring) builds on the foundational knowledge from course 1. You'll follow an SRE team preparing to onboard a new application into their production environment.

### What You'll Learn

This course focuses on the technical implementation of observability:

- The three pillars of observability: logging, metrics, and tracing
- Setting up monitoring stacks with Elasticsearch, Prometheus, and Grafana
- Designing effective alerting strategies that avoid alert fatigue
- Automating incident response with [CI/CD](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd) pipelines
- Exploring [AIOps](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/aiops-artificial-intelligence-operations) and machine learning for advanced monitoring

![Monitoring applications in SRE with OpenTelemetry](/content/images/2025/07/sre-2-monitor.png)

### Course Outline

**Module 1: Onboarding to SRE: Observability Requirements**  
Learn what data applications need to expose for SRE teams to manage them effectively. Covers structured logging with the [EFK stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack) and distributed tracing with [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/).

**Module 2: Measuring "Good" with Service Level Indicators**  
Deep dive into implementing meaningful SLIs using Prometheus, including how to expose metrics from application components and aggregate them for monitoring.

**Module 3: Alerting on "Bad" to Trigger Incident Response**  
Design alerting strategies that trigger the right response - automated fixes for known issues or pages for unknown problems. Includes integration with [OpsGenie](https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie).

**Module 4: Automating Remediation with Pipelines**  
Reduce toil by automating common fixes using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflows triggered by your monitoring stack, with status updates posted to [Slack](https://slack.com/).

**Module 5: Next-level SRE: Machine Learning and AIOps**  
Explore how AIOps platforms like [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) can augment traditional SRE practices with machine learning-driven anomaly detection and automated incident analysis.

## Real-World Tools and Practices

Both courses use the same tools you'll find in production SRE environments:

- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Logging**: Elasticsearch, [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/), [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/)
- **Tracing**: Tempo, OpenTelemetry
- **Alerting**: OpsGenie, [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/)
- **AIOps**: Datadog

Every demo shows working implementations to back up the theory. You'll see realistic incidents being investigated, actual dashboards being built, and automation workflows in action.

## Who Should Take These Courses?

The courses are designed for:

- Developers who work with SRE teams or want to understand SRE practices
- Operations engineers looking to transition to SRE
- Team leads and managers evaluating SRE for their organization
- Anyone involved in digital transformation initiatives

No deep technical knowledge is required for the first course - just a basic understanding of software development and deployment processes.

## What's Next?

The next two courses in the learning path will complete your SRE education:

**SRE: Resiliency and Automation** will focus on building systems that can withstand failures and automating responses to common issues. You'll learn how to design for resilience, implement chaos engineering practices, and create self-healing systems.

**SRE: Measuring and Optimizing Reliability** will cover advanced techniques for quantifying and improving system reliability, including complex SLO hierarchies, reliability budgeting, and using data to drive architectural decisions.
