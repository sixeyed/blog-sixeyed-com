I've been blogging over at [Geeks with Blogs](http://www.geekswithblogs.net/eltonstoneman) since [2008](http://www.geekswithblogs.net/EltonStoneman/archive/2008/04/04/using-perforce-with-cruisecontrol.net.aspx) but I'm finally jumping ship and moving [here](http://blog.sixeyed.com).

All the old content will stay on GWB, but if you want to see new stuff, here's where it will be.

Why the move? GWB provide a great service, but a lot has changed since 2010:

- the Cloud got invented, in particular [Azure Web Apps](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/app-service/web/), so self-hosting a fast, reliable and scalable blog has become super easy
- they made [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org) which lets me run the whole blog for real in a development VM, test new themes, functional changes etc. and push it all to Azure when I'm ready
- GWB didn't really keep up. It runs on [Subtext](https://github.com/Haacked/Subtext/) and the best authoring tool is [Windows Live Writer](http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=8621). Neither have had much love for a little while.

So this is the new home. I like having control over the theme, so I will style it up a bit over time. The publishing experience is so much easier that I may even get more posts out there...
