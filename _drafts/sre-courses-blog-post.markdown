Site Reliability Engineering is how Google runs production systems, and it's becoming the standard approach for managing complex applications at scale. I've just published the first two courses in a new [SRE learning path on Pluralsight](/l/ps-sre-path), with two more courses coming soon to complete the path.

SRE achieves the same goals as DevOps - high availability with high velocity - but without requiring a massive culture shift. It's an engineering approach to operations that focuses on automation, measurement, and removing toil. For many organizations starting their digital transformation, SRE provides a more structured path forward than traditional DevOps adoption.

I cover the easy(ish) way to add reliability at scale with container orchestration in my 5\* Pluralsight course [Managing Apps on Kubernetes with Istio](/l/ps-istio).

## The SRE Learning Path

The complete [Site Reliability Engineering learning path](/l/ps-sre-path) takes you from SRE fundamentals through to advanced practices:

1. **SRE: Concepts and Principles**
2. **SRE: Monitoring and Observability**
3. **SRE: Resiliency and Automation** (coming soon)
4. **SRE: Measuring and Optimizing Reliability** (coming soon)

Let's dive into what's covered in the first two courses.

## Course 1: SRE Concepts and Principles

[SRE: Concepts and Principles](/l/ps-sre-concepts) is your entry point into Site Reliability Engineering. Over 90 minutes, you'll follow two experienced SREs as they deal with real production scenarios.

### What You'll Learn

The course covers the foundational concepts through practical demonstrations:

- How SRE differs from traditional IT operations and DevOps
- Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Objectives (SLOs), and error budgets
- Incident management and the importance of blameless postmortems
- Core SRE tools for monitoring and alerting

### Course Outline

**Module 1: Investigating Issues: On-Call with an SRE**  
Follow an on-call SRE dealing with a disk space issue in Elasticsearch. You'll see how SREs approach problems differently from traditional ops teams, using engineering practices to solve operational challenges.

**Module 2: Classifying and Tracking Performance with Service Levels**  
Join another SRE investigating a performance issue that's burning through error budget. This module explains the key concepts of SLIs and SLOs while demonstrating logging and distributed tracing tools.

**Module 3: Managing Risk and Reducing Downtime**  
Learn how to use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to confirm root causes and work with development teams on architectural solutions.

**Module 4: Handling Failure with Incident Management**  
When the initial fix doesn't work and the incident escalates, you'll see how SREs use a structured incident management approach to investigate and get to quick resolution.

**Module 5: Reflecting and Improving Practices with Postmortems**  
Wrap up with a blameless postmortem that connects both incidents and provides a path forward for preventing future issues.

## Course 2: SRE Monitoring and Observability

[SRE: Monitoring and Observability](/l/ps-sre-monitoring) builds on the foundational knowledge from course 1. You'll follow an SRE team preparing to onboard a new application into their production environment.

### What You'll Learn

This course focuses on the technical implementation of observability:

- The three pillars of observability: logging, metrics, and tracing
- Setting up monitoring stacks with Elasticsearch, Prometheus, and Grafana
- Designing effective alerting strategies that avoid alert fatigue
- Automating incident response with CI/CD pipelines
- Exploring AIOps and machine learning for advanced monitoring

### Course Outline

**Module 1: Onboarding to SRE: Observability Requirements**  
Learn what data applications need to expose for SRE teams to manage them effectively. Covers structured logging with the EFK stack and distributed tracing with Tempo.

**Module 2: Measuring "Good" with Service Level Indicators**  
Deep dive into implementing meaningful SLIs using Prometheus, including how to expose metrics from application components and aggregate them for monitoring.

**Module 3: Alerting on "Bad" to Trigger Incident Response**  
Design alerting strategies that trigger the right response - automated fixes for known issues or pages for unknown problems. Includes integration with OpsGenie.

**Module 4: Automating Remediation with Pipelines**  
Reduce toil by automating common fixes using GitHub Actions workflows triggered by your monitoring stack, with status updates posted to Slack.

**Module 5: Next-level SRE: Machine Learning and AIOps**  
Explore how AIOps platforms like DataDog can augment traditional SRE practices with machine learning-driven anomaly detection and automated incident analysis.

## Real-World Tools and Practices

Both courses use the same tools you'll find in production SRE environments:

- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Logging**: Elasticsearch, Kibana, Fluentd
- **Tracing**: Tempo
- **Alerting**: OpsGenie, PagerDuty
- **AIOps**: DataDog

Every demo shows working implementations, not just theory. You'll see genuine incidents being investigated, actual dashboards being built, and automation workflows in action.

## Who Should Take These Courses?

The courses are designed for:

- Developers who work with SRE teams or want to understand SRE practices
- Operations engineers looking to transition to SRE
- Team leads and managers evaluating SRE for their organization
- Anyone involved in digital transformation initiatives

No deep technical knowledge is required for the first course - just a basic understanding of software development and deployment processes.

## What's Next?

The next two courses in the learning path will complete your SRE education:

**SRE: Resiliency and Automation** will focus on building systems that can withstand failures and automating responses to common issues. You'll learn how to design for resilience, implement chaos engineering practices, and create self-healing systems.

**SRE: Measuring and Optimizing Reliability** will cover advanced techniques for quantifying and improving system reliability, including complex SLO hierarchies, reliability budgeting, and using data to drive architectural decisions.

## Getting Started

Ready to learn how Google keeps systems running at scale? Head to the [Site Reliability Engineering learning path](/l/ps-sre-path) to get started. Begin with [SRE: Concepts and Principles](/l/ps-sre-concepts) to understand the fundamentals, then move on to [SRE: Monitoring and Observability](/l/ps-sre-monitoring) for hands-on implementation details.

SRE isn't just for Google-scale operations. The principles and practices work for any team running production systems. Whether you're managing a handful of services or hundreds, SRE provides a framework for balancing reliability with feature velocity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need prior SRE experience to take these courses?**  
A: No, the first course starts with fundamentals. Basic software development and deployment knowledge is helpful.

**Q: What tools will I learn?**  
A: Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Tempo, OpsGenie, and modern AIOps platforms like DataDog.

**Q: How long does the complete learning path take?**  
A: The four courses total approximately 6 hours, designed to be completed over 2-3 weeks.

**Q: Is this Google's exact SRE approach?**  
A: These courses teach the core SRE principles Google pioneered, adapted for general enterprise use.
